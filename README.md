##  Problem Formulation: Predicting Housing Prices and Loan Approval Trends

###  Context and Purpose
This project addresses challenges in understanding and forecasting housing prices and loan approval outcomes using real-world datasets. By combining socioeconomic, geographic, and financial data, the solution aims to provide insights that can support informed decision-making for home buyers, lenders, and planners.

###  Research Questions
1. How strongly are median income and proximity to the coast associated with higher housing prices?  
2. Can housing prices be classified into meaningful tiers using machine learning?  
3. Is there a relationship between education level and loan approval rates?  
4. Can the housing market be segmented into distinct clusters using unsupervised learning?

###  Hypotheses
- Higher income and coastal proximity are positively correlated with higher house prices.  
- Credit score is a strong predictor of loan approval.  
- Housing prices naturally fall into distinct pricing categories that can be learned by a classifier.  
- Education level influences the likelihood of loan approval.  
- The housing market forms natural clusters based on geography and socioeconomic factors.

###  Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Joblib

###  Annotation
This project tackles the challenge of making housing and financial data accessible and actionable through predictive modeling and interactive visualization. The housing market is notoriously complex and opaque, especially for non-experts, and this tool provides data-driven insight into pricing, classification, and segmentation. The solution uses machine learning models to predict house value, classify pricing tiers, evaluate loan eligibility, and cluster housing regions. It offers an interactive web application with accessible visualizations for usability. The solution benefits prospective home buyers, real estate professionals, and policy makers by improving transparency and helping users understand the factors that influence property value and approval likelihood.

### (Quick note two of the models couldn't be uploaded becasue of their size.)
